# EchoUI
Just a simple widget tool I'm working on. It currently has the following features

* Folder Widget: Lets you select a specific folder on your drive and display all the icons in that folder
* Shortcut Widget: Lets you add specific shortcuts and add arguments to them
* All Widgets: Has the ability to minimize the view to just the title
* All Widgets: Custom coloring per widget

**To Do**
* Add more Widgets
* Bug Fixes
